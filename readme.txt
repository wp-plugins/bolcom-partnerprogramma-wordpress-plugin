Bol.com Affiliate Partner program to sell goods on your own website.

== Description ==

Bol.com Affiliate Partner Program Plugin allows you include bol.com products on your own website and earn affiliate
commission from the bol.com Partner Program.

With this plugin you can add specific bol.com products. This includes three types of views: Product links, Search widgets
and Bestseller lists. You can include these in your posts, pages and sidebar.

Bol.com is the number one online retailer in the Netherlands, with more than three million customers and 10% of the online market,
and has a growing presence in Belgium. It offers non-food products in a wide range of categories, delivered direct to people’s homes.

== Minimal requirements ==

* Wordpress 3.1.1 or higher
* PHP version 5.3+ with the cURL extension installed and enabled and the PHP server setting 'short_open_tag' set to value On,
mbstring and parse_ini_file() functions enabled
* No interfering with other plugins (f.e. [Page Builder Plugin](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder))

== Step by step installation guide ==

1. Sign up for a partner program account with your website at [http://partnerprogramma.bol.com](http://partnerprogramma.bol.com) and get a siteid.
2. Sign up for a developer account with your website at [http://developers.bol.com](http://developers.bol.com) and request a API-key.
3. Install the plugin within your Wordpress site. You can upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the plugin option in the admin.
4. A new entry in the left menu will appear ('Bol.com').
5. Click on the 'Bol.com' menu entry. A settings page will appear. Insert your Partner Program SiteId, API Access Key and API Secret Key.
6. Click on the 'save changes' button and check the 'Bol.com Open API connection test' to see or a connection with the API can be made. If it says status successful
you can start using the widgets. If you get an error check your API Access Key and API Secret Key they may be incorrect. You can also check the FAQ section on this page.
7. Go to the “Widgets” section or add a “Post” or “Page” and select from the toolbar what you want to include.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No solution to your problem in this section? Go to the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bolcom-partnerprogramma-wordpress-plugin/)

= Fatal error: Call to undefined function BolPartnerPlugin\Widgets\Renderer\mb_strlen() =

There is a problem with your hosting environment. Be sure to run on PHP version 5.3 and check or mb_strlen() is supported.


= When inserting a widget by 'Selecting category' I cannot make a choice =

Check or your page contains javascript errors. This will cause the plugin not to work. If you make sure all the javascript
errors are gone the plugin should work again.


= Only blank images appear of products wit bol name in it =

Everything seems right except blank images appear. With the value Off in the admin a widget could be added successfully
(categories could be loaded, so the API-key was set correctly) but the inserted short code in the WYSIWYG editor was incomplete.

This could be caused by the PHP server setting 'short_open_tag'. If this is set set to value Off (must be set to value On)

Wrong example:
[bol_bestsellers limit="5" block_id="bol__bestsellers" cat_id="8299" name="jkkj" sub_id="" title="" background_color="FFFFFF" text_color="0000FF" link_color="000000" border_color="D2D2D2" width="250" cols="1" show_bol_logo="1" show_price="1" show_rating="1" link_target="1" image_size="1"]

Good example:
[bol_bestsellers limit="5" block_id="bol_521c4fbb57e2b_bestsellers" cat_id="8299" name="jkkj" sub_id="" title="" background_color="FFFFFF" text_color="0000FF" link_color="000000" border_color="D2D2D2" width="250" cols="1" show_bol_logo="1" show_price="1" show_rating="1" link_target="1" image_size="1"]

The block_id missed an unique id. This caused another problem in the frontend of the website. The javascript missed also an unique id:

wrong example:
<script type="text/javascript">BolPartner_SelectedProducts = {"bol_<!--?= uniqid() ?-->_selected-products":

good example:
<script type="text/javascript">BolPartner_SelectedProducts = {"bol_521c4f9e4944f_selected-products":

When you notice you can retrieve categories, but you have one of the following problems please review your PHP server settings.


= Can I add the short code by directly in the content without using the WYSIWYG editor? =

The short code can be inserted via the WYSIWYG editor by clicking on the Bol.com code. This will generate an unique code with it's own number.

You can insert the short codes by yourself by changing the number but using the editor is much easier and provides you with more options.


= Can I install the plugin in Wordpress MU? =

We have not tried the plugin on a MU WordPress installation yet and it is currently not supported. When you install the
plugin on multiple websites you need to have different API-keys and partner id's for the different domains.


= The link of a product redirects to http://www.bol.com/nl/index.html and not to the product =

Check the source code and check the url. There should be a &s=[your partner id number] in the url.

If the s= field is empty you should check your config settings. A partner id should be provided.

http://partnerprogramma.bol.com/click/click?p=1&t=url&s=[your partner id number]&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bol.com%2Fnl%2Fp%2Fhet-voedselzandloper-kookboek%2F9200000016778638%2F&f=WP_BSL&subid=&name=Test

= Plugin can't connect with the Bol.com Open API. Fatal error: 'SSL certificate problem' =

The connection test fails and gives the following error:
Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'RuntimeException' with message 'SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK.
Details: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed'

The problem is caused due to your web server settings. To retrieve information from the Bol.com API a secure https connection
is used. Retrieving information via the secured https connection causes a problem on your server. When you correct this
the plugin should work.

Probably the CA certificates are out of date.

A "CA" is shorthand for a "certificate authority," a third-party group responsible for handling secure connections around the web.
They establish digital "certificates," which are a way of ensuring that there are valid connections between two machines
(like your computer and https://openapi.bol.com). Without a certificate, the security risk between two machines is greater.

When you receive this error, it likely means that your CA is out-of-date and needs to be updated. Generally, updating your
OS will also update your CA and solve the problem. (https://help.github.com/articles/error-ssl-certificate-problem-verify-that-the-ca-cert-is-ok)

Your provider should check the settings of the certificate authority. More information can be found here: [http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html)
